## Linux Hints:
1)	You may find yourself typing and retyping a lot of the same commands. To get around this, you can hit the Up-Arrow key, which will cycle through past commands you’ve typed.
2)	In the terminal, Linux commands are case and space sensitive, so be careful with any space and upper/lower case when you input commands.
3)	You can hit “Tab” while typing a command, option or file name and the shell environment will automatic complete what you are typing or suggest options to you.
